## UE4DotNet

### Introduction
UE4DotNet is a plugin for UnreakEngine 4 that permits scripting UE4 using any DotNet language (including C# and F#).  It currently supports UE4 4.21 and DotNet Foundation (Windows only), but future versions will support later UE4 version and DotNet Core 3.0 and DotNet 5.0 (when available).

### Installation
UE4DotNet is a C++ plugin for UE4.  It requires Visual Studio 2017 to compile.

To install, create a new UE4 game based on the the Blank Blueprint template.  Download and install the UE4DotNet/Plugins repository in the Plugins folder (GameFolder/Plugins/DotNet).  Launching the editor will cause the plugin to recompile and it should be ready.
